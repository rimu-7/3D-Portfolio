# 3D Portfolio - React + Vite

This is a 3D portfolio built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), providing an interactive and visually dynamic user experience.

## Features

- 3D interactive portfolio showcasing projects and skills
- Fast and optimized development with Vite
- Smooth animations and 3D elements powered by React Three Fiber

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for managing dependencies

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rimu-7/3D-Portfolio.git
```
### 2. Install dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd 3D-Portfolio
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

Once dependencies are installed, start the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:5173`. Open the URL in your browser to view the 3D portfolio.

### 4. Build for production

To create a production build of the app, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized, production-ready build in the `dist/` directory.

### 5. Preview the production build

After building the app for production, you can preview it with the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will serve the production build locally, so you can see how it will behave in a live environment.
